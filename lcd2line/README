Making a digital clock with Raspberry Pi with I2C+MCP23017 on two line LCD.
Copyright (c) 2013 sean93.park@gmail.com

1. System

Raspberry Pi I2C signal to 16 bit parallel with MCP23017,
and MCP23017 to 16 characters 2 line LCD.

2. Circuit

Refer image file circuit_rpi_i2d_mcp23017_lcd2line.png file, it's the circuit.


3. Application

Simple Two Line Date/Time clock.
It gets current time from time() and localtime().


4. Source

rpi_i2c.cpp: Raspberry Pi I2C control part
rpi_lcd1602.cpp : 16 character 2 line lcd control part using I2C and MCP23017
main.cpp : main application sending date/time clock to LCD


5. Build

Run make on root. Output is created at build folder.
Output folder can be changed by modifing makefile.

$ cd raspberrypi-basic/lcd2line
$ make


6. Execution

Copy build/rpilcd file to your raspberry pi.
You can use samba, scp (ssh copy) or ftp.
Run in your RPi console or terminal
