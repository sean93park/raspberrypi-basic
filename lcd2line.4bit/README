1. System

Raspberry Pi I2C signal to 16 bit parallel with MCP23017,
and MCP23017 to 16 characters 2 line LCD.

2. Circuit

Refer image file circuit_rpi_lcd2_ir.png file, it's the circuit.


3. Application

Simple Two Line Date/Time clock with infra red receiver module.
It gets current time from time() and localtime().

main.cpp : main application sending date/time clock to LCD


5. Build

Run make on root. Output is created at build folder.
Output folder can be changed by modifing makefile.

$ cd raspberrypi-basic/lcd2line.4bit
$ make


6. Execution

Copy build/rpilcd file to your raspberry pi.
You can use samba, scp (ssh copy) or ftp.
Run in your RPi console or terminal
